# PIDBOX
solidworks, code, and fritzing of PID box project
This is my PID box project.
For my project I made a pressure fit box, which took a lot of planning for it.
My box is 125x125 for all the sides. then I had to make a little thing 
that holds the motor. This was 3d printed, and fit the motor.
I also made a very tiny little wheel that fit on top of the motor.
In here is also the fritizing for my box. In the fritizing there is all the 
needed things besides the leds. Also the batterypack doesnt 
show that the motor needs 6v and the arduino needs 5v. So there had to be an 
extra wire added. There is a switch that controls on/off
and one that controls the pid. The potientiometer took a litttle while but 
displays on the lcd screen which is using a lcd backpack.
Also in my project I used a arduino and prototyping shield so it looks 
different, and is slightly different.
Luke did the code but I know that it works, it controls the motor and uses 
pid. Also the potientmeter controls how fast the motor goes.

For the sides of my box some problems I had were with making sure all the 
sides were the same I struggled with getting how big and small the tabs 
had to be. I also struggled with the best way to make the tabs. 
I ended up making one and then would pattern it over multiple axises so 
that all the tabs were the same. 
Also figuring out what goes with what was confusing, 
but I figured it out by drawing it out and then figuring measurements,
 instead of first doing measurements.
Then for figuring out all the holes that were needed was firguring out placement of them all. This was hard because I had to make sure they would all fit but also not crammed together. A few times I got how big the holes had to be luckly I made them too small so I could just laser the hole a little smaller. 
For the wheel I made the thing that fit on the motor not deep enough, to fix that I drilled the hole a little longer which fixed the problem. With the motor holder circle I made the hole that was supposed to hold a screw alittle to small so the head of the screw wouldn't fit but instead I used a piece of wire. Also I forgot to make a little thing to hold the photointerrupter so I had to just kind of bend the wires to hold the photointerrupter in place, it worked.
I had lots of problems with the wiring for this project. I had to figure out how to wire the battery pack, so I could get the different powers. Then the motor had problems, it would spin, but the potientmeter wouldn't controll it. So I rewired the motor. The potientmeter worked then. The lcd backpack worked. I forgot a switch to controll the pid so I had to back and add that in. The photointerupter had no problems. Eventually everything fit together.
